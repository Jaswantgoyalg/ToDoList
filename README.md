## Features

- Filter button funcationality: You can actually filter your pending and completed tasks.
- Delete-All Button: in case you want to clear whole task list.
- Tasks priority wise: When you update a new task it will add to the top so you don't have to scroll down and look.
- Live on github: Successfully uploaded as github repository.
- UI/UX design: Used CSS3, fonts, padding, margin, transformations and transitions, FlexBox layout to make the website look attractive and user-friendly.
- Animated Background: Added a cool animation in the background image.
- User Authentication and Login: User first have to login with personal 'username' and 'password'. I have setted a dummy username as 'jaswant' and password as '1234'. After that it will go to the main todo page.html, where your tasks are added.
- LocalStorage: After adding the tasks, the current look of the page is saved in the browser's LocalStorage.
- Responsive design: User can synchronized between multiple devices.
- Comments in the code: I have added simple and conceptual comments in every line of code in all files, to helping the understanding the logicÂ forÂ others.


## Further More Possible Advanced improvements

- Implement a daily task reminder/notification
- Implement a recycle bin, so when you delete any task it will be temporarily stored there for some days.
- Implement login-logout dynamically, for wide range of users.
